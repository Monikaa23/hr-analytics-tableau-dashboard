# HR Analytics Dashboard | Tableau & Excel

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end HR analytics workflow focused on understanding employee attrition, workforce composition, and job satisfaction. Using Excel for data preparation and Tableau for visualization, the dashboard provides a centralized view of key HR metrics that support retention strategy and workforce planning.

The objective of this project is to transform raw employee data into clear, decision-ready insights for HR leaders and business stakeholders.

## Business Problem
Human Resources teams often struggle to identify:
- Which employee groups are most impacted by attrition
- How demographics and job satisfaction influence turnover
- Where proactive retention efforts should be focused

This dashboard addresses those challenges by enabling data-driven analysis of employee trends across departments, age groups, education levels, and gender.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau Desktop** – Interactive dashboards and visual analytics
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, preparation, and validation
- **Basic Statistics** – Trend and distribution analysis

## Data Preparation & Cleaning
The dataset was prepared using Excel with a focus on data quality and consistency:
- Removed duplicate employee records
- Standardized column formats and naming conventions
- Corrected spelling inconsistencies across categorical fields
- Trimmed unwanted spaces and normalized text case
- Reviewed and handled missing values without impacting analysis integrity
- Applied find-and-replace techniques for data standardization

These steps ensured accurate and reliable reporting in Tableau.
